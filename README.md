# lowes

This is how you feel the Todo application
1. Clone the Repo ( git clone https://github.com/rajasekharthunga/lowes.git ) then move to lowes folder ( cd lowes )
2. Goto Backend Folder ( cd Backend )
3. Do " npm run dev ", It starts the server in localhost: 3003 PORT, Make sure it runs in the same PORT. If something is already running KILL the port (npx kill-port 3003 )
4. If server runs on 3003 ( You can check the console in the terminal saying ' Server is running on port 3003 ' and ' Connected to MongodB ', then move to Frontend folder ( cd .. & cd Frontend/todo)
5. Do a ' npm install '
6. Run 'npm run start '
7. Starts the UI, play with the UI.

You can feel the Todo application.
Thank you.
